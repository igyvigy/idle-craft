Inspired by samhogan's [Minecraft-Unity3D](https://github.com/samhogan/Minecraft-Unity3D), Idle-Craft is the attempt to combine minecraft with MMORPG idle grinder, where ugly squared guy replaced with cute [Unity-Chan!](https://unity-chan.com)

## Features:

- Fixed original project's bugs
- Implement blocks bag and quick access dock with drag and drop
- Improve terrain generation performance with use of C# Job system
- The blocks now have a level that increases as you move away from the center.
- The higher the level of the blocks, the longer you need to dig them. And the grass and tree blocks are now even regenerating at the same time
- No more ruined ugly world, since destroyed blocks will respawn again. The bigger block's level, the longer it's respawn time!
- Make a queue from the blocks so that Unity-chan! fucks them while you do more important things. She will run from one to another using the ultimate path-finding system
- Ever wanted propper third-person view in Minecraft? Now you have it! Switch between perspectives on the fly.
- Includes touchscreen controls for mobile devices
